# Machine Learning Sample

## Project 1: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network in Keras
- Use one-hot encoding for categorical columns
- MLP neural networks expand in the middle and the shape of the network is optimized
- Use of fully connected (dense) layers and RELU activation function
### Data sets
- Breast cancer 
## Project 2: Clustering and Unsupervised Learning in scikit-learn

## Project 3: MLP Neural Networks in Tensorflow with Jupyter Markdown
