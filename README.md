# Machine Learning Code Sample

## Project 1: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network using Keras
### Features
- Use one-hot encoding for categorical columns
- MLP neural networks expand in the middle and the shape of the network is optimized
- Use of fully connected (dense) layers and RELU activation function
### Details
- Predict malignancy (binary classification) in [UCI breast cancer data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29) 
- Classification of iris flowers in [UCI Iris data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
- Identify digit based on image in [Kaggle MNIST data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) using convolutional neural network
